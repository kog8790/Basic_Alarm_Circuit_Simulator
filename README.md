# Basic_Alarm_Circuit_Simulator
The intended purpose for this program is to simulate a basic alarm circuit.

The following components will be integrated into this program for the purpose of simulating an alarm circuit:
  1. Alarm Panel: 8 points with shared common between each pair of points. Total of 12 terminal screws. Inductance of 3.3v for each point.
  2. Grid: a 24x24 grid to place components on and measure voltage and resistance between points or nodes on this grid.
  3. Conductors: 4 conductor colors Green, White, Red, and black. These conductors have .0001 ohms resistance.
  4. Resistors: 1K, 2.2k, 5k, and 10k resistors will be optional components to place in the circuit on the grid
  5. Switch: Each switch will have 3 terminals. A normally closed terminal, normally open terminal, and a common terminal.
  6. Multimeter: This component computes the math of measuring across any two nodes on the grid/circuit.
