# Basic_Alarm_Circuit_Simulator (More technically a dual EOL resistance in circuit calculator) or RICC(Resistance In Circuit Calculator)
The intended purpose for this program is to simulate a basic alarm circuit to serve as a training module for Alarm Technicians learning dual EOL circuit basics.

This was my very first program that I wrote all on my own. Before this I had done some projects with open source code that I edited a bit to make it do what I needed for my use case but had never written anything from scratch.

In it's current form it's still a bit shy of my aspirations.

Here is a list of things I'm still looking to do with it.
  1. Have a drop down style menu for selecting resistance value and a plus sign button to add the resistor of that value to the board.
    - Need dynamic class instance creation based on selection
  3. Move short circuit line and calculation to center of circuit rather than at the end.
  4. Have one of the circuits be normally open so that there is a normally open and normally closed side for testing and training
  5. Create a panel type drop down menu that changes what values constitute the different states i.e Alarm, Secured, Trouble, etc...
  6. Add a daisy chain feature that switches the view from two independent circuits to a single daisy chain circuit with the two HUBs.
  7. Lastly my current executable doesn't include the images. Meaning they have to be downloaded seperately. I would like to include them all in a single file.
